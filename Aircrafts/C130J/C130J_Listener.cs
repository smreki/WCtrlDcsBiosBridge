/// C-130J CNI-MU repeater.
///
/// DCS-BIOS carries the aircraft but not its CNI-MU — the module declares every switch and
/// lamp and not one line of the display. What is shown here therefore comes from the
/// wctrl-export.lua UDP feed, which scrapes the pilot's and the copilot's CNI, and the CNI is
/// the only page this listener offers.
///
/// One listener drives one CDU and answers to one seat, named at construction and fixed for the
/// life of the listener: the copilot's CNI reaches a panel only when a second CDU has been given
/// that seat. The aircraft cannot say where the crew is sitting — pilot and copilot share a
/// single camera point in the module's Views-30.lua and no cockpit state moves between them —
/// so a lone CDU stays on the pilot's rather than guessing.
///
/// The indication carries element names and values and nothing else — no position, no font
/// size, no highlight. The layout comes from <c>Resources/c130j-cni-pages.json</c>, extracted
/// offline from the module's own page scripts by <c>tools/cni-schema</c>.
///
/// One lamp comes off the same feed: the CNI-MU's EXEC annunciator, which nothing readable
/// reports. DCS-BIOS declares it as PLT_CNI_EXEC_LED on cockpit argument 3390, but that
/// argument never leaves zero — tried, and the lamp stayed dark. <see cref="CniExecLamp"/>
/// works it out from the page title and the EXEC keypresses instead, and holds it — the marker
/// is only on the modified page, so a lamp recomputed from whatever page is on screen would go
/// out the moment the crew turned away.
/// That lamp is the aircraft's rather than the seat's, so it is fed both seats' packets while
/// the screen is fed only this one's.
